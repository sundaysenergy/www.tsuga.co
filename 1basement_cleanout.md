Hello fellow residents. My name is Kai Curry and I work with Tsuga, the building owners. I've been helping care for the apartments the past few months. The owners are excited to make the building the best it can be. The new carpet and paint in the hallways is just the beginning. I'll be leading a few projects in the near future I want to tell you about.

## Basement Cleanout

We will begin by performing a thorough clean and dump starting Tuesday the 29th. I need your help making sure your belongings don't get tossed.

If you have anything in the basement you want to keep, please move it out of the basement, affix a sign to it, or lock it in your basement storage unit. If those options don't work for you please contact me ASAP and I'll find a solution that works for you.

If you want your storage unit cleaned out and painted so you can move stuff in there, please let me know before Tuesday and it will get cleaned. If you need help moving anything let me know. If you need a lock, a light fixture/bulb replaced or have an issues about anything please let me know.

Come Tuesday, anything left in common areas or in unlocked storage units will be disposed of. Bikes, air conditioners, mattresses, bed frames, desks, paint, furniture, and computers will all be removed.

## Parking

The parking space between the apartment building is available for rent on a week-to-week basis. The price is $50 per week. You can rent the space online at http://tsuga.co. Don't get caught parking there without signing up online first or your car will be towed.

The local businesses have been complaining that tenants have been parking in the lot intended for customers. If your car is found in the lot it will be towed. If you have questions about the parking lot rules please let me know.

## Outside Door Lock Change

I like having as few keys as possible. Currently, the outside front and back doors have different keys. They will be fitted to accept a new key that opens both the front and back doors. One advantage of the new lock system is that your new outside door key will be unique to your unit. This makes it possible to refit the locks on your apartment doors to accept your unique outside door key. Yes, it is possible to have one key that opens both the front and back outside _and_ inside doors. Please let me know how many keys you'd like and if you'd like to schedule an update to your apartment locks. The new keys will be arriving by mail over the next week. Please put the new key on your keyring so you are prepared when the locks change. I'd like to have this done on Monday, Feb 4th. However, I will not move forward with the lock change unless I hear from everyone in the building.
